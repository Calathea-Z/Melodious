TECH: React, Node.js, Next.js, Tailwind.CSS, Recoil.js

APP SUMMARY: This will be an app that lets users play music from spotify and  build Spotify playlist based on suggestions given from typing prompts to the Chat GPT AI and sure that with their friends.


Key Feature: Playlist Suggestion

 User input might be:

        "Music from Iceland, only female singers please, atmospheric."

The AI will then return a list of artists and a play list will be built form that which can be played and built in the app through spotify. 

Another one might be:

        "I want to listen to Guns N' Roses but only their soft quiet songs."

The AI will the return a list of quiet Guns N' Roses songs and a playlist will be built using those parameters. 


Stretch Goals: I believe the project will be challenging enough.
